/// Describes how a type is initialized and fetched as a system parameter.
///
/// # Available Parameters
///
/// - [`&World`] and [`&mut World`]
/// - [`Commands`]
/// - [`Query`]
/// - [`Local`]
/// - [`Res`], [`ResRef`], [`ResMut`]
/// - [`NonSend`], [`NonSendRef`], [`NonSendMut`]
///
/// Each parameter has a persistent [`State`](SystemParam::State) stored alongside
/// the compiled system. That state is initialized once, contributes borrow
/// information to the system access table, and is then used to fetch the concrete
/// [`Item`](SystemParam::Item) passed into the system body on each run.
///
/// Built-in implementations cover individual parameters, optional parameters, and
/// tuples of parameters. Manual implementations are primarily for extending the
/// ECS runtime with new parameter kinds.
///
/// # Aliasing rules
///
/// `SystemParams` must obey Rust aliasing rules. For example, `(Res<Foo>, ResMut<Foo>)` is
/// invalid and will panic at runtime.
///
/// Also note the difference between world access:
/// - `&World` represents shared access to all data in the world.
/// - `&mut World` represents exclusive access to all data in the world.
///
/// Therefore, `(&World, Res<Foo>)` is valid, while `(&World, ResMut<Foo>)` and
/// `(&mut World, Res<Foo>)` are invalid and will panic at runtime.
///
/// `Commands` is a deferred command queue and is modeled as not directly
/// accessing resources/components. Therefore, `(&mut World, Commands)` is
/// technically valid (though usually not very useful).
///
/// [`&World`]: crate::world::World
/// [`&mut World`]: crate::world::World

/// [`NonSendMut`]: crate::borrow::NonSendMut
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementations must report access patterns accurately from
/// [`mark_access`](SystemParam::mark_access) and must only produce items from
/// [`build_param`](SystemParam::build_param) that are valid for the supplied world and
/// ticks. Incorrect implementations can violate aliasing guarantees enforced by
/// the scheduler.
