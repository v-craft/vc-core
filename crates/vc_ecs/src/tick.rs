//! Tick is the world timestamp mechanism used primarily for change detection.
//!
//! It is a 32-bit integer representing a discrete point in time. Because it can
//! overflow and wrap around, it is not suitable for timeline synchronization
//! across different instances.
//!
//! The world maintains a continuously advancing `Tick` named `now` as the current
//! moment. Since `now` wraps on overflow, we must also cap the maximum observable
//! age between two ticks.
//!
//! Every [`CHECK_CYCLE`] ticks, all component/resource tick markers are validated
//! to ensure their age does not exceed [`MAX_TICK_AGE`]. This can introduce a
//! periodic pause (roughly every 8 hours), but the work is chunked and spread
//! across threads, so the runtime impact is typically small.
