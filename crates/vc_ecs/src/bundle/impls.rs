/// A trait for types that can be used as bundles of components.
///
/// # Overview
/// Bundles provide a way to group multiple components together for efficient
/// insertion and spawning operations. They serve as a convenience layer that
/// abstracts away the complexity of managing individual components when creating
/// or modifying entities.
///
/// # Implementation
/// Bundles can be created in two ways:
/// - **Derived automatically**: For tuples of components (up to 16 elements)
/// - **Manual implementation**: For custom bundle types with special requirements
///
/// # Bundle Lifecycle
/// When a bundle is used to spawn an entity, the following process occurs:
/// 1. **Component Collection**: All component types in the bundle are collected
///    via [`collect_components`](Self::collect_components). This phase determines
///    which component types this bundle provides.
/// 2. **Archetype Resolution**: The ECS finds or creates an archetype matching
///    the collected component set.
/// 3. **Storage Allocation**: Space is allocated in the appropriate archetype.
/// 4. **Component Writing**: Component values are written to storage via
///    [`write_fields`](Self::write_fields) and [`write_required`](Self::write_required).
///
/// # Writing Semantics
/// The bundle trait distinguishes between two types of component writes:
///
/// ## Explicit Fields ([`write_fields`](Self::write_fields))
/// - Writes components that are explicitly provided in the bundle
/// - Later fields override earlier ones if duplicates occur
/// - Used for primary component initialization
///
/// ## Required Components ([`write_required`](Self::write_required))
/// - Writes components that must exist but may not be explicitly provided
/// - Only writes if the component hasn't been written yet
/// - Useful for default values or required dependencies
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementing this trait manually requires careful attention to memory layout
/// and component invariants. The implementor must ensure:
///
/// ## Collection Safety
/// - [`collect_components`](Self::collect_components) must register **all**
///   component types that this bundle can write (both explicit and required)
/// - Component IDs must be valid and properly initialized
/// - Duplicate registrations are allowed and will be deduplicated
/// - Registration order does **not** need to match write order
///
/// ## Writing Safety
/// - [`write_fields`](Self::write_fields) and [`write_required`](Self::write_required)
///   must write components at the correct memory offsets
/// - Writes must not overflow the allocated storage
/// - Component data must be properly aligned
/// - Type safety: The written data must match the registered component type
pub unsafe trait Bundle: Sized + Sync + Send + 'static {
    /// Collects all component types that this bundle can provide.
    ///
    /// This method is called during bundle processing to determine the complete
    /// set of component types that this bundle might write. The collected set
    /// is used to find or create the appropriate archetype for entities spawned
    /// with this bundle.
    ///
    /// # Safety
    /// - Every component type written in [`write_fields`](Self::write_fields) or
    ///   [`write_required`](Self::write_required) **must** be registered here.
    /// - Registering extra component types that are never written is disallowed.

    ///
    /// This method handles components that are directly provided in the bundle.
    /// If duplicate components exist (e.g., in tuple implementations), later
    /// fields override earlier ones.
    ///
    /// # Safety
    /// - All component writes must be to types that were registered in
    ///   [`collect_components`](Self::collect_components)
    /// - All writes must be within allocated storage bounds
    /// - Component data must be properly aligned
    /// - The type being written must match the registered component type
    /// - The `base` offset must be valid for the current storage context

    ///
    /// This method ensures that all necessary components exist for an entity,
    /// even if they weren't included in the explicit bundle fields. It only
    /// writes components that haven't been written yet, preserving any
    /// user-provided values.
    ///
    /// # Safety
    /// - All component writes must be to types that were registered in
    ///   [`collect_components`](Self::collect_components)
