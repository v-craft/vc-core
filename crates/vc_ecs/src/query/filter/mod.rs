/// Core trait for types that can filter entities in a query.
///
/// The following filters are available:
///
/// | Filter | Description |
/// |--------|-------------|
/// | `And<(F1, F2, ...)>` | Logical AND - all inner filters must be satisfied |
/// | `Or<(F1, F2, ...)>` | Logical OR - at least one inner filter must be satisfied |
/// | `With<C>` | Requires the entity to have component `C` |
/// | `With<(C1, C2, ...)>` | Requires the entity to have all specified components |
/// | `Without<C>` | Requires the entity to NOT have component `C` |
/// | `Without<(C1, C2, ...)>` | Requires the entity to have none of the specified components |
/// | `Changed<C>` | Component `C` must have been modified in the interval `(last_run, this_run]` |
/// | `Added<C>` | Component `C` must have been added in the interval `(last_run, this_run]` |
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - [`QueryFilter::State`] - Static data shared across all query instances
/// - [`QueryFilter::Cache`] - Per-execution cached data for a specific world state

/// component access patterns. See trait methods for specific safety requirements.
