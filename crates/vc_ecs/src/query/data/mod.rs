/// Core trait for types that can be fetched from entities in a query.
///
/// This trait defines how a query accesses data from entities. It is implemented
/// for component references, tuples of components, and other data sources.
///
/// # Available Params
///
/// The following query data forms are supported:
///
/// - **Entity handles**: `Entity`, `EntityRef`, `EntityMut`
/// - **Component references**: `&T`, `&mut T`, `Ref<T>`, `Mut<T>` where `T` is a component type
/// - **Optional components**: `Option<&T>`, `Option<&mut T>`, `Option<Ref<T>>`, `Option<Mut<T>>`
///
/// Tuples composed from these forms are also valid, for example `(&Foo, &mut Bar)`.
///
/// # Aliasing rules
///
/// `QueryData` must obey Rust aliasing rules. For example, `(&Foo, &mut Foo)` is
/// invalid and will panic at runtime.
///
/// Also note the difference between entity-only and entity-wide access:
/// - `Entity` carries only an entity ID and does not access components.
/// - `EntityRef` represents shared access to all components on that entity.
/// - `EntityMut` represents exclusive access to all components on that entity.
///
/// Therefore, `(EntityRef, &Foo)` is valid, while `(EntityRef, &mut Foo)` and
/// `(EntityMut, &Foo)` are invalid and will panic at runtime.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementing this trait requires careful attention to memory safety and
/// component access patterns. See trait methods for specific safety requirements.
