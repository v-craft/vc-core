/// operations targeting one entity.

/// Like [`Commands`], submitted operations are deferred and are not executed
/// immediately. They are first accumulated in an internal local buffer and
/// transferred to the world's global command queue when [`flush`] is called.
/// The local buffer is also flushed automatically when this value is dropped.
///
/// For a single `EntityCommands` instance, queued operations execute in order.
/// Relative ordering with operations from other command buffers depends on
/// when each buffer is flushed.
