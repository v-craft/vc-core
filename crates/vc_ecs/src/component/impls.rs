//! Core component trait definition for the entity-component system.

//! This module defines the fundamental `Component` trait that all components

// Component

/// The core trait for all components in the entity-component system.
///
/// This trait must be implemented for any type that can be used as a component.
/// It provides essential metadata about the component's behavior, including
/// mutability, storage strategy, cloning behavior, and required dependencies.
///
/// # Derive Macro
///
/// For most component types, prefer using the [Component derive macro].
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use vc_ecs::derive::Component;
/// // Basic usage - mutable component without clone capability
/// #[derive(Component, Default)]
/// struct Foo;
///
/// // Cloneable component
/// #[derive(Component, Clone, Default)]
/// #[component(clone)]
/// struct Bar(String);
///
/// // Component with required dependencies
/// #[derive(Component)]
/// #[component(required = Bar)]
/// struct Baz;
///
/// // Immutable component with sparse storage
/// #[derive(Component, Default)]
/// #[component(mutable = false, storage = "sparse")]
/// struct Logger { /* .. */ }
///
/// // Combined: copyable, immutable, with multiple required dependencies
/// #[derive(Component, Clone, Copy)]
/// #[component(copy, mutable = false, required = (Foo, Bar))]
/// struct GameVersion<T: Copy>(T);
/// ```
///
/// [Component derive macro]: crate::derive::Component
///
/// # Features
///
/// ## Storage
///
/// Two storage strategies are supported: `dense` and `sparse`, configured via
/// [`Component::STORAGE`].
///
/// When using the derive macro, you can set storage with
/// `#[component(storage = "dense/sparse")]`.
///
/// See [`ComponentStorage`] for implementation details.
///
/// ## Mutable
///
/// Components are mutable by default, but can be made immutable with
/// [`Component::MUTABLE`].
///
/// When using the derive macro, mutability can be configured via
/// `#[component(mutable = true/false)]`.
///
/// If a component is immutable, APIs such as `get_mut` and `fetch` cannot return
/// mutable references (they return `None`). A mutable `Query` access instead
/// returns an error, which by default may lead to a panic.
///
/// ## Cloner
///
/// Copy/clone behavior is controlled by [`Component::CLONER`], and is disabled
/// by default.
///
/// The default is conservative because generic `T` cannot be universally
/// determined as `Clone` at compile time in stable Rust.
///
/// To opt in, use [`Cloner`]:
/// - For `Clone` types, use [`Cloner::clonable`].
/// - For `Copy` types, use [`Cloner::copyable`] (more efficient).
///
/// With the derive macro, this can be configured via `#[component(copy)]` or
/// `#[component(clone)]`.
///
/// ## Required
///
/// Dependency components are configured via [`Component::REQUIRED`], which
/// defaults to `None`.
///
/// Required components act like dependencies. If component `A` requires `B`,
/// then spawning or inserting `A` will automatically add `B` via [`Default`]
/// when `B` is missing.
///
/// Any component used as a required dependency must implement [`Default`].
///
/// Multiple required components are supported via tuples, for example:
/// - `const REQUIRED: Option<Required> = Some((A, B, C, D));`
///
/// With the derive macro, use `#[component(required = T)]`.
///
/// ## Dropper
///
/// [`Component::DROPPER`] stores the function pointer for [`Drop::drop`].
///
/// [`Dropper`] extracts this pointer at compile time, so users usually do not
/// need to specify it manually.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Although this trait is not declared `unsafe`, incorrect implementations can
/// still cause serious bugs, including:
/// - Memory unsafety in component storage and access
/// - Violation of thread safety guarantees
/// - Incorrect component versioning and tick tracking
/// - Undefined behavior in component cloning and mutation
///
/// The default provided configuration is safe.
