//! This module provides the implementation of `ScopeExecutor`,
//! 
//! The executor system employs a three-tier design:
//! 
//! - `GlobalExecutor`: Global, work-stealing executor shared across all threads in a pool
//! - `LocalExecutor`: Per-thread executor for thread-local tasks
//! - `ScopeExecutor`: Per-thread executor for scoped tasks or cross-thread transfers

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Scope Executor

/// A **thread-affine** multi-producer, single-consumer async executor.
///
/// `ScopeExecutor` is designed to be used inside [`TaskPool::scope`] for **scoped
/// parallelism**.
///
/// It allows tasks to be spawned from **any thread**, but enforces that **all task
/// execution happens on the thread where the executor was created**.
///
/// ## Execution Model
///
/// - Tasks may be spawned from multiple threads (MPSC).
/// - Tasks are stored in a thread-safe queue.
/// - Only the owning thread may **tick** the executor and execute tasks.
/// - Execution is explicit: the executor does not run in the background.
///
/// ## Single-Threaded Environments
///
/// In `no_std` or WASM environments, `LocalExecutor` is used instead.
/// `ScopeExecutor` is unavailable and accessing it will panic.
///
/// ## Multi-Threaded Environments
///
/// Each thread owns **one** `ScopeExecutor`, stored in thread-local storage.
///
/// Unlike `LocalExecutor`, a `ScopeExecutor` does **not automatically drive itself**.
/// The owning thread must explicitly call `tick()` via a [`ScopeExecutorTicker`].
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// `ScopeExecutor` fills the gap between:
///
/// - `LocalExecutor`: thread-local, non-`Send`, cannot receive tasks from other threads.
/// - `GlobalExecutor`: global, load-balanced, but with no guarantee which thread executes a task.
///
/// It enables **thread-directed scheduling**:
///
/// - Tasks can be *sent* to a specific thread.
/// - Execution remains deterministic and thread-affine.
///
/// ## Typical Use Cases
///
/// - Scoped parallelism with deterministic thread assignment.
/// - Running tasks on the main thread from worker threads.
/// - Integrating async tasks into thread-bound event loops.
///
